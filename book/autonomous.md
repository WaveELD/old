The notion of **autonomy** of a physical model is essential for the approach here.

A physical model is **autonomous** if it can be implemented in a computer simulation and run to simulate *any* phenomena within the scope of the model, given an appropriate set of initial conditions, modulo any approximations and inaccuracies attributable to the computer simulation relative to the *true* underlying model (e.g., discretization effects).

This is in contrast to many types of models in physics, termed *analytic models*, where a specific set of equations is configured to analyze one particular type or class of problems. That set of equations would not work for other classes of problems within the same general scope -- e.g., it relies on particular assumptions and special conditions, etc, to make it tractable to solve.

In quantum physics, many (most) equations operate in [configuration space](configuration_space "wikilink") which has the dimensionality of the number of particles involved, so it is practically impossible to articulate a general autonomous model, even for a restricted domain of spacetime.

Philosophically, our universe is presumably autonomous in this same sense (minus the computer simulation part.. though one never knows..) -- it just "runs" autonomously. We don't imagine there is some kind of agent looking at a complex system of equations and figuring out how to solve them for different specific conditions that happen to arise in different places in the universe. Instead, there is just a single set of universal laws operating autonomously.. understanding those laws must be the true and ultimate goal of physics.</text>
